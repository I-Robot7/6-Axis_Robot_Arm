# 6-Axis_Robot_Arm


Robots are physical agents that perform tasks by manipulating the physical world.
To do so, they are equipped with effectors such as legs, wheels, joints, and grippers. 
Effectors have a single purpose: to assert physical forces on the eniroment.

This repository contains STL files to print Niryo One with a 3D printer.

Note : You need at least a 200mm*200mm*200mm 3D printer to be able to print all the parts.

You can find Niryo One ROS stack here : https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros

Enjoy !
