# 6-Axis_Robot_Arm


Robots are physical agents that perform tasks by manipulating the physical world.

To do so, they are equipped with effectors such as legs, wheels, joints, and grippers. 

Effectors have a single purpose: to assert physical forces on the eniroment.



Industrial robots are great for their purpose: Production and Precision. 

However, their price are really still too high. 
An industrial robot will cost you between US$20.000 and US$200.000


Do you need such a robot for teaching and learning robotics ? 
No, all you need is a 6-Axis Robot Arm that you can build by yourself.



This repository contains STL files to print a 6-Axis Robot Arm with a 3D printer.

Note : You need at least a 200mm *200mm *200mm 3D printer to be able to print all the parts.

Enjoy !
